Okay, let's see. The user provided an incomplete Small Basic code snippet: 'Identifier . Identifier ( Expression )'. They want me to complete that part. Hmm, I need to figure out what a valid Small Basic statement would look like here.

First, in Small Basic, the syntax for methods usually follows the object followed by a dot, then the method name and parameters. Like TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello"). So maybe the first Identifier is an object, the second is a method, and the Expression is the argument.

Possible objects in Small Basic include TextWindow, GraphicsWindow, Math, etc. Let's think of common methods. For example, TextWindow.WriteLine or GraphicsWindow.DrawRectangle. The Expression could be a variable, number, or an expression like x + y.

So maybe the correct completion is something like TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello World"). Or perhaps using GraphicsWindow's methods. Let me pick a common one. Since the user didn't specify, I should choose a standard example
Actual result:  TextWindow . Write ( "Enter your Name: " )

Okay, let's see. The user provided an incomplete Small Basic code starting with "TextWindow" and then the placeholder '. Identifier ( Expression )'. They want me to complete that part.

First, I need to recall what the TextWindow object in Small Basic does. The TextWindow object has methods like WriteLine, Read, ReadNumber, etc. The most common one is probably WriteLine, which outputs text to the console. 

The structure here is TextWindow followed by a dot, so the next part should be a method or property of TextWindow. The user mentioned an identifier followed by an expression in parentheses. So the identifier is the method name, and the expression is the argument.

Since the user didn't specify what exactly they want to achieve, I should go with the most straightforward example. Maybe a simple WriteLine statement. For instance, TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello World"). That would make sense as a common example. Alternatively, maybe they want to read input, like TextWindow.Read(), but
Actual result:  . Write ( "Enter your Name: " )

Okay, let's see. The user provided an incomplete Small Basic code snippet: TextWindow. followed by 'Identifier ( Expression )'. They want me to complete that part.

First, I need to recall what methods and properties are available for the TextWindow object in Small Basic. The main ones are WriteLine, Read, ReadLine, and maybe Write. The syntax usually requires parentheses around the arguments.

The placeholder is "Identifier ( Expression )". The identifier here should be one of those methods. Since the code starts with TextWindow., the next part is probably a method call. The most common one is WriteLine, which outputs text. So maybe it's TextWindow.WriteLine("something"). But without more context, it's hard to know exactly what they want. 

Alternatively, maybe it's Read or ReadLine for input. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps the simplest completion is using WriteLine with a sample string. Let me think of a typical example. Like TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello,
